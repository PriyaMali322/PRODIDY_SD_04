This Python project is a Sudoku solver that uses a backtracking algorithm to solve 9x9 Sudoku puzzles. It includes functions to input a puzzle, validate possible numbers, and print the solved board. Users enter the puzzle row by row, with 0 representing empty cells, and the program fills in the missing numbers to complete the puzzle.
